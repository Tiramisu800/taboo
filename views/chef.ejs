            <p>Did you dream about becoming an astronaut when you were a kid?
                Well, that childhood dream can actually become a reality with a whole lot of training!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Astronauts are trained to pilot and/or travel in a spacecraft, work in space, and do
                activities related to human space exploration. While space flight may now seem routine,
                every trip into space can be a walk between success and disaster.
                Therefore, most of an astronaut's career is spent undergoing extensive training.
