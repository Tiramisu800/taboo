            <p>The chef is the most important person in the kitchen. Its main task is to control what is happening,
                manage production processes and personnel. He is responsible for the quality of dishes, updating the menu
                and pricing.

            <br>
            <p> To become a chef, you have to go through the entire career ladder in the kitchen. Ordinary cooks cut, boil,
                bake for 12 hours a day. Senior chefs or foremen coordinate their work and at the same time continue
                to stand at the stove. They are led by sous chefs, who are responsible for
                organizing the work of the kitchen and tracking what the waiters take to the tables
                of the guests.
