            <p>We all once wanted to learn how to play a musical instrument and perform on stage in front
                of thousands of people. But it did not go further than solo concerts in his room or at school
                events and a "naive" childhood dream.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> And all because in society there are many stereotypes and attitudes about creative professions,
                especially musicians and artists.

            <h2>What does a Musician do?</h2>
            <p>
                How often have you heard that music is not serious and that you
                cannot provide yourself financially with singing and dancing?
                All this is wrong, because being a musician is much more than playing notes on an instrument.
                Learning to choose the right instrument for yourself and start making music can change the lives of many people.
                It is more than a hobby, a skill or a talent.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> First, a musician is a person who composes, conducts, or performs music.
                If you want to be a musician, you can learn to develop the skills you need to be the musician you want to be and make the
                music you want with practice.

                <li>NASA has strict requirements for being an astronaut. The job not only needs you in top
                    physical shape, but it also demands the technical skills to take on difficult jobs in
                    a spacecraft or on a space station far from home.</li>
                <li>Astronaut candidates must also have skills in leadership, teamwork and communications.</li>
                <li>Working as an astronaut typically requires higher levels of intelligence when compared
                    with the average career. This means that astronauts are required to actively learn new
                    things related to their discipline and solve complex problems.</li>
                <li>A career as an astronaut typically depends predominantly on qualities you can gain
                    through experience, with a small aspect of skills you are born with.</li>
            </ul>
